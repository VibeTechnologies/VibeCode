# VibeCode

A Python package that provides a single-command solution for running Claude-Code MCP server with automatic Cloudflare tunneling.

## Features

- üöÄ Single command to start everything
- üåê Automatic Cloudflare quick tunnel setup
- üîí Unique UUID paths for each session
- üì° SSE transport support
- üõ†Ô∏è Zero configuration required

## Installation

```bash
pip install vibecode
```

This will automatically install all dependencies including `mcp-claude-code`.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- `cloudflared` CLI tool (for tunnel functionality)

### Installing cloudflared

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install cloudflared
```

**Linux:**
See [Cloudflare documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/installation)

## Usage

### Start with tunnel (recommended)

```bash
vibecode start
```

This will:
1. Generate a unique UUID path
2. Start the Claude-Code MCP server locally
3. Create a Cloudflare quick tunnel
4. Print the public URL for use in ChatGPT/Claude

Example output:
```
Starting MCP server on port 8300...
Starting Cloudflare quick tunnel...

============================================================
üöÄ Claude-Code MCP server is running!
============================================================

üì° Public URL: https://example-subdomain.trycloudflare.com/a1b2c3d4e5f6...

To use with ChatGPT or Claude:
1. Copy the URL above
2. Add it to your MCP configuration
3. Set transport type to: sse

‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: This is a temporary tunnel that will expire when stopped.
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server and tunnel.
```

### Start local-only (no tunnel)

```bash
vibecode start --no-tunnel
```

### Custom port

```bash
vibecode start --port 9000
```

## Configuration in ChatGPT/Claude

Add the provided URL to your MCP configuration with:
- **URL**: The complete URL shown (including the UUID path)
- **Transport**: `sse`

## Limitations

- Cloudflare quick tunnels are temporary and will get new URLs each time
- SSE support in quick tunnels is not officially guaranteed by Cloudflare
- For production use, consider setting up persistent Cloudflare tunnels

## Security Notes

- Each session generates a unique UUID path
- Quick tunnels automatically expire when the process stops
- The tunnel URL is randomly generated by Cloudflare

## Troubleshooting

### cloudflared not found
Install cloudflared or run with `--no-tunnel` for local-only mode.

### Port already in use
Use `--port` to specify a different port.

### SSE connection issues
Quick tunnels may have limited SSE support. If you experience issues, consider using persistent tunnels.
